# Real-Estate-Marketplace-blockchain-Mern
ABSTRACT:
Traditionally Dealing and Buying real estate is done physically by documents. These documents can be tampered with or indeed in some cases fake documents can be generated, for verification of the sell and buy took time as it takes time to search from the piles of documents as there are a number of deals passing every day currently These records are stored online but it uses traditional database hence it can be manipulated So to solve this problem we've created an application which will keep the record of deals on a blockchain network as the blockchain is immutable once a sale is done it cannot be changed and a permanent record will be created. In this application when the owner lists a property, this system lists the property as an NFT, when the buyer wants to buy a property, he buys that property NFT i.e. the ownership of the property is transferred to the buyer in the system.
